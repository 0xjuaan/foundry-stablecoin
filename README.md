## Stablecoin
1. Anchored/Pegged to USD
    - Chainlink price feed
    - Set a function to exchange ETH and BTC to USD in the perfect way
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Not centralised like USDT or USDC)
    - You can only mint it with enough collateral (in the code)
3. Collateral Type: Exogenous (Unlike TerraUSD hehe)
    - wETH, wBTC collateral
